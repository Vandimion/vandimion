### Hi there 👋, I'm Vandimion!
*"I only exist inside those people who are aware of my existence."* 

A quote from Iwakura Lain (she's literally me).

>🌱 I'm currently learning the Java programming language (and a bit of Korean language on the side, ty Duolingo).
>
> 🃏 I plan to create programs revolved around card games (blackjack, poker, cribbage) and document them by uploading them here.
>
> ⚡ Fun fact: I love JRPGs! I'll probably make one for my own someday, but that would entirely depend on my cat's emotional health so... 🤷
>
> 📫 How to reach me: vandi.mion04@gmail.com.
